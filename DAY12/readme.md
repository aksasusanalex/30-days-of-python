Task: Swap Two Elements in a Tuple
Description:
In this task, you will swap two elements of a tuple without changing the tuple itself (since tuples are immutable). You will convert the tuple to a list, swap the elements, and then convert it back to a tuple.

Steps:
Create a tuple with at least two elements.
Swap the first and second elements of the tuple.
Print the original tuple and the tuple after the swap.
