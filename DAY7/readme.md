Task: Add Strings to a List Using append() and Print Them Using a for Loop
Description:
In this task, you'll create an empty list and then use the append() function to add strings to the list. After adding a few strings, you will use a for loop to print each string in the list.

Example Code Template:
python
Copy code
# Start with an empty list
my_list = []

# Add strings to the list using append()
my_list.append("Apple")
my_list.append("Banana")
my_list.append("Cherry")

# Use a for loop to print each string in the list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
Instructions:
Start with an empty list my_list = [].
Use the append() function to add your own strings to the list. For example, you could add names of your favorite foods, animals, or hobbies.
After adding a few strings, use a for loop to print each string in the list.
Example Output (if you append fruits):
Copy code
Apple
Banana
Cherry
