# Day 10: Multiplication Table Using Nested Loops

## Task: Print a Multiplication Table Using Nested Loops

### **Objective:**
Learn how to use **nested loops** to generate a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5.

### **Description:**
In this task, you will use nested loops to create a multiplication table. The outer loop will iterate through the numbers 1 to 5, and the inner loop will iterate through the same range to generate the multiplication results.

### **Steps to Complete the Task:**
1. **Outer Loop:** Use the outer loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 5.
2. **Inner Loop:** For each number from the outer loop, use the inner loop to iterate again from 1 to 5.
3. **Print Multiplication:** For each combination of the outer and inner loop variables, print the multiplication result.
4. **Tabular Format:** Ensure the multiplication results are printed in a neat, tabular format by separating each result with a tab space.
5. **New Line After Each Row:** After printing all results for a particular row, move to the next line.

### **Expected Output:**
The multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5 should look like this:

1 x 1 = 1 1 x 2 = 2 1 x 3 = 3 1 x 4 = 4 1 x 5 = 5
2 x 1 = 2 2 x 2 = 4 2 x 3 = 6 2 x 4 = 8 2 x 5 = 10
3 x 1 = 3 3 x 2 = 6 3 x 3 = 9 3 x 4 = 12 3 x 5 = 15
4 x 1 = 4 4 x 2 = 8 4 x 3 = 12 4 x 4 = 16 4 x 5 = 20
5 x 1 = 5 5 x 2 = 10 5 x 3 = 15 5 x 4 = 20 5 x 5 = 25
