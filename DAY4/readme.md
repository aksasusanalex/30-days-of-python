# Day 4: `while` Loop Task 2

## Task: Sum of Positive Numbers Using a `while` Loop

### Description:
Write a Python program that continuously asks the user for a number using the `input()` function. The program should add the numbers entered by the user and print the cumulative sum. The loop should stop when the user enters a negative number. When the loop stops, print the total sum of the positive numbers entered.

### Example:

Enter a number (negative number to stop): 5 Enter a number (negative number to stop): 3 Enter a number (negative number to stop): -2 Total sum of positive numbers: 8.0

### Explanation:
- The program continuously asks the user to input numbers.
- If the entered number is positive, it gets added to the `total_sum`.
- When a negative number is entered, the loop stops and the final sum is displayed.
