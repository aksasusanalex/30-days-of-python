Day 11: Tuples 
Task: Tuple Element Access and Modification
Description:
In this task, you will work with a tuple and perform basic operations such as accessing elements, slicing, and trying to modify a tuple using a list (since tuples are immutable).

Steps:
Create a Tuple:

Create a tuple with the following elements: "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date".
Access and Print Elements:

Access and print the second and third elements from the tuple.
Slice the Tuple:

Slice the tuple to get elements from index 1 to 2 and print the resulting tuple.
Try to Modify the Tuple:

Since tuples are immutable, attempt to change the first element and print the result.
